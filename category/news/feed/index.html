<p>Every year, the U.S. Commercial Service (the trade promotion arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration) helps thousands of U.S. companies export goods and services worth billions of dollars. As part of our outreach, the VetsGoGlobal initiative can work with Veteran-owned businesses to identify and take advantage of export opportunities. Our global network is located throughout the United States and in U.S. Embassies and Consulates in more than 70 countries.</p>
<h4 class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="22.4" data-lineheight="25.76px"><strong>Why Export?</strong></h4>
<p>Over 90% of all consumers live outside the U.S. borders; foreign consumers hold 75% of global purchasing power.</p>
<h4 class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="22.4" data-lineheight="25.76px"><strong>Should  Export?</strong></h4>
<p>Veteran-owned businesses thrive at international business due to their effective decision-making, perseverance, sound ethics and compliance, and global understanding.</p>
<h4 class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="22.4" data-lineheight="25.76px"><strong>How do  Start?</strong></h4>
<p>Developing an international business strategy can be labor-intensive for any company. Whether you are looking to make your first export sale or expand to additional markets, we can help you jump-start your efforts through our trade counseling, business matchmaking, market intelligence and commercial diplomacy.</p>
